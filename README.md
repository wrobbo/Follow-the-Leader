# Follow-the-Leader
A simple game made in C++ with the openFrameworks toolkit.

The game I created is based off the flash game Cats. In Cats, there are a number of the animals walking back and forth across the screen. For a random period of time, one of the cats will be elected 'leader' and the user will have to click on the cats to ensure they are all copying the leader, and if they are, the users points will increase. There are only two states the cat can have; sitting or walking. My game is very similar, but instead of cats it simply has boxes going back and forth across the screen. The user has to rack up as many points as possible in a certain amount of time!
